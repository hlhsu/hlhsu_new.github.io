I am broadly interested in provably and practical decision-making.
More specifically I'm interested in:

* Reinforcement Learning (robustness, safety, offline)
* Multi-armed Bandit (multi-agent, Thompson Sampling)
* Robotics, drone
* Neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation)


I am advised by [Miroslav Pajic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fbn21-8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
