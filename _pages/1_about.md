### Personal

I’m Hao-Lun (Howard) Hsu, a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Duke University advised by Prof. [Miroslav Pajic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fbn21-8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I am an <b><a href="https://tast-nrt.pratt.duke.edu/">NSF TAST-NRT fellow</a></b> and supported to study surgical robotics in my first year.

My research concerns **Reinforcement Learning**, including [safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14325) and [robustness]([https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DjsDccl-Dc8x3vqGcyw5Iu1aja2uZd6A&authuser=shokawano5%40gmail.com&usp=drive_fs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07408)) with applications of robotics and neuromodulation.

I received M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU). During my master's studies, I was advised by Prof. [Sehoon Ha](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Q6F3O0sAAAAJ&hl=en) to collaborate with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on developing safe RL algorithms for robotics and worked with Prof. [Babak Mahmoudi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xHDleCQAAAAJ&hl=en) on RL closed-loop control for neuromodulation. I have previously worked for Curai Health, Reazon Holdings, inc., Abbott Vascular, and Dassault Systèmes.
