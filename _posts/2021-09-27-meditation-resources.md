Interested in trying meditation?  Here are some incredible resources I recommend:

**App**:  *Ten Percent*

By far the best meditation app that provides excellent instructions from some of the best meditation teachers in the world.  Although it presents the content in a secular fashion, it does so while respecting the Buddhist philosophy that underlies it (unlike apps like headspace).  It also has made a lot of effort to promote teachers from various backgrounds, so chances are, you'll find one that fits your style.

Here is a [30 day free guest pass](https://redeem.tenpercent.com/?promo_code=TPH-ZY1U-ZFE9).  For full disclosure, I do not make any money from this link.  

**Website for a deep dive**:

David Sudar has an amazing [website for all things meditation](https://www.pathofsincerity.com/) for those who want to go deeper.

**Retreats**

Personally, I found that extended meditation retreats significantly deepened my practice. All of the things that provide unnecessary friction in your mind may be withstood in a 10 min meditation session.  But when you're meditating for multiple days intensively, you will have to confront them. A daily practice is like wiping the kitchen counter and a retreat is a deep clean.

It can be an intense experience but life changing   I also think practicing meditation with others is extremely helpful (in a retreat setting or otherwise).   Here is a list of retreat centers recommended by [Ten Percent Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/retreats) if you're interested. If you're in the Sacramento area, feel free to come to [my meditation group](https://www.instagram.com/yps_sactoInsight/).

If you want something shorter, many meditation teachers and centers offer day-long retreats to help you dive deeper into practice.
I personally like the day-long retreats offered by [Alexis Santos](https://www.alexissantos.io).
